Learnt a lot about Controlled Impedances, Via Stitching, 4-Layer Board Design, Prioritising Sensitive Devices, Choosing PCB Trace Width, 
Using Polygonal Pours, Differential Signalling, Bypass, Decoupling Capacitors, Referring to Reference Design w a pinch of salt, using 
Fiducial Markers.

Still not perfect.
